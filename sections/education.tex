%  My research focuses on photogrammetry and 3D reconstruction for territorial and infrastructural monitoring. 
%  My research focuses on UAV-based and terrestrial photogrammetry for land and infrastructure monitoring. I am working on a low-cost image-based system for 4D glacier monitoring (\href{https://github.com/franioli/icepy4d}{ICEpy4D}) and UAV-photogrammetry for structural health assessment and crack detection on concrete bridges.
